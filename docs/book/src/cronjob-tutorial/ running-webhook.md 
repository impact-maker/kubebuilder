Deploying Admission Webhooks
Kind Cluster

It is recommended to develop your webhook with a kind cluster for faster iteration. Why?

    You can bring up a multi-node cluster locally within 1 minute.
    You can tear it down in seconds.
    You don't need to push your images to remote registry.

Cert Manager

You need follow this to install the cert manager bundle.
Build your image

Run the following command to build your image locally.

make docker-build

You don't need to push the image to a remote container registry if you are using a kind cluster. You can directly load your local image to your kind cluster:

kind load docker-image your-image-name:your-tag

Deploy Webhooks

You need to enable the webhook and cert manager configuration through kustomize. config/default/kustomization.yaml should now look like the following:

{{#include ./testdata/project/config/default/kustomization.yaml}}

Now you can deploy it to your cluster by

make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/<project-name>:tag

Wait a while til the webhook pod comes up and the certificates are provisioned. It usually completes within 1 minute.

Now you can create a valid CronJob to test your webhooks. The creation should successfully go through.

kubectl create -f config/samples/batch_v1_cronjob.yaml

You can also try to create an invalid CronJob (e.g. use an ill-formatted schedule field). You should see a creation failure with a validation error.
The Bootstrapping Problem

If you are deploying a webhook for pods in the same cluster, be careful about the bootstrapping problem, since the creation request of the webhook pod would be sent to the webhook pod itself, which hasn't come up yet.

To make it work, you can either use namespaceSelector if your kubernetes version is 1.9+ or use objectSelector if your kubernetes version is 1.15+ to skip itself.
